# Advanced React E-Commerce Web App


To successfully build our advanced e-commerce application and achieve the learning objectives, we need to establish clear project requirements. These requirements outline the key features and functionalities that our application must encompass. Below, you'll find a comprehensive list of project requirements based on our learning objectives:


Our project leverages the FakeStoreAPI to simulate asynchronous data fetching. This API, available at https://fakestoreapi.com/, provides a simulated environment for fetching product/category data. By utilizing this mock API, we can demonstrate the capabilities of the advanced topics reviewed within our Moduleâ€™s Lessons.


While both Context API and Redux Toolkit are valuable tools for state management, we'll focus on Redux for this project to deepen understanding and practice with Redux concepts.


Additionally, we'll encourage the use of React Query for data fetching due to its simplicity and efficiency, while still allowing flexibility for the use of Redux Toolkit for state management.

**PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**
**Product Catalog**

*Product Listing and Display:*
- Use React Query to retrieve all of the products in the store and display them on the Home component.
- Show the title, price, category, description, rate, and image.
- Each product should have a button that will allow the user to add it to the shopping cart
